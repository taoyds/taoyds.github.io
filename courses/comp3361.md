## Course Description

Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of human language from a computational perspective. Over the past 20 years, the field of NLP has evolved significantly, primarily driven by advancements in statistical machine learning and deep learning. A notable recent breakthrough is the development of "pre-trained" language models, such as ChatGPT, which have substantially enhanced capabilities across various applications. This course is an introductory undergraduate-level course on natural language processing. In this class, we will cover recent developments on core techniques and modern advances in NLP, especially in the era of large language models. Students will gain the necessary skills and experience to understand, design, implement, and test large language models through lectures and assignments. We will potentially also host invited speakers for talks.â€¯

## Prerequisites

- COMP3314 or COMP3340; and MATH1853
- We require students to have prior knowledge undergraduate linear algebra, probability and statistics, machine learning, or deep learning. Familiarity with Python programming is required.

## Course Materials

There is no required textbook for this course. [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/jacobeisenstein/gt-nlp-class/blob/master/notes/eisenstein-nlp-notes.pdf) by Jacob Eisenstein is recommended if you would like to read more about NLP. Readings from papers, blogs, tutorials, and book chapters will be posted on the course website. Textbook readings are assigned to complement the material discussed in lecture. You may find it useful to do these readings before lecture as preparation or after lecture to review, but you are not expected to know everything discussed in the textbook if it isn't covered in lecture. Paper readings are intended to supplement the course material if you are interested in diving deeper on particular topics.
